#                                                 NumPy

NumPy is besically a package for workin with arrays. You know that, Python does not have any souce of array manupulation.
Hence, it has the feature called List which is acctually a complex dinamic linked list, stack, queue etc.

Thus for array counting perposes, numpy appered. Almost all the packages and modules used in data scice or machine learning, 
is built with numpy array. It is basically a package for counting matrics.


Although, numpy is a third party  module, it is not already in our python, whatever version we use. So we have to install it to work.
We will use pip for installation.

$ pip install numpy

If it does not work, then type

$ python -m pip install numpy

Here is a thing, if you have installed Anaconda, then numpy is already installed in your python. Now all you have to do is install Jupyter Notebook. It uses the interface of 
IPython with the extention .ipynb. Run this command to install Jupyter notebook in your PC.

$ pip install notebook

Or,

$ python -m pip install notebook

In order to run your notebook, click on Start button and open Jupyter notebook software. You can also run it from your terminal. Run this command,

$ jupyter notebook

Jupyter Notebook will appear on your browser
