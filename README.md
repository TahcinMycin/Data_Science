# Data Science
This repository is created for all data scientist
We will basically use these Python libraries

  1. Numpy
  2. Pandas
  3. Matplotlib
  4. Seaborn

If you don't have python installed, then install it from this link
https://www.python.org/downloads/
We also have to install some packages. So run these commands in your cmd or power shell

$ pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn

We will also install Jupyter Notebook for IPython interface

$ pip install notebook

After installation run your Jupyter notebook

$ jupyter notebook


# It will be better if you install Anaconda. It contains all the packages for data science & machine learning

https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual#Downloads

That's all you need.
